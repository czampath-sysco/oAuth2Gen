## ðŸš€ Standalone Executable Usage

Standalone executables are available for Windows, Linux, and Mac. **Only the Windows build has been tested.**

### 1. Download the Executable

- Windows: `dist/oauth2gen-win.exe`
- Linux: `dist/oauth2gen-linux`
- Mac: `dist/oauth2gen-mac`

### 2. Run the Executable

- On Windows: `oauth2gen-win.exe`
- On Linux/Mac: `./oauth2gen-linux` or `./oauth2gen-mac`

Your browser will open at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

1. Fill in your OAuth2/OIDC providerâ€™s details:
   - Authorization Endpoint
   - Token Endpoint
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Scope
2. Click **Generate Token** and follow the authentication flow.
3. Your token will be displayed and can be copied for use.
4. **New:** Applications can now request the token directly from this server via the `/token` endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/token`). No need to copy and paste the token manually.

> **Note:** Do not change the port or redirect URI unless you know what youâ€™re doing. The redirect URI is always `http://localhost:8080/callback`.

> **API Note:** All localhost ports are allowed for CORS. You can access the `/token` endpoint from any local application running on any port.

> **Disclaimer:** Only the Windows executable has been tested. Linux and Mac builds are provided for convenience and may require additional testing or adjustments.
